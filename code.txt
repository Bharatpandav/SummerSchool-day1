What is Navigation Structure?
Navigation structure refers to how links and menus are organized on a webpage (or across a site) to help users move around easily and find information quickly.

Using the <nav> Element: The <nav> element is a semantic container specifically meant for navigation links.

Hierarchical Organization: Navigation menus are often organized as lists (<ul> and <li>) to create a logical order and structure.

Linking Pages and Sections: Navigation links (<a href="...">) point to other pages or sections within the page.
